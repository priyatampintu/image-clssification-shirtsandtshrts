11. What is the main difference between a web scraper and a web crawler?
Answer:- The main difference is that web crawlers usually focus on indexing the web while web scrapers extract or "scrape" data from webpages.
         A web scraper's main purpose is to extract data from webpages. Web scrapers often have the ability to browse to different pages and follow links.
         Though web scrapers can crawl to different pages their primary purpose is scraping the data on those pages, not indexing the web.
