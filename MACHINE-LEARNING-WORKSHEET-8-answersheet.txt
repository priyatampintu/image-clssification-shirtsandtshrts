1. A) The mean of the Є is zero
   C) Є is the error which is introduced because there may be some predictor variables apart from the given variable which are effecting the response variable.
   
2. A) It covers up the errors introduced because of the variables which are not present in        the given predictors set X but they are influencing the response variable.
B) It also covers up the measurement errors in the response variable.
C) It covers up the error introduced because we can never find the exact or true f(X).

3. A) The distribution of random error will be Gaussian.
   C) The random error will be dependent on X.

4. A) To predict the sales of a product based on the marketing budget on different media like TV, Newspaper,Radio, etc.
C) To predict the stock price of a company based on the previous stocks prices.

5. A) The random error can be reduced by Least squares method.
   B) The random error can be reduced if we try to fit a non-linear curve to the data.  

6. B) Least Squares Method
   A) Minimum error loss

7. B) y1 = B where B is a parameter.
   C) y1 = B* Sin(x) + C, where B and C are parameters  

8. C) Cosine function of AGE
   
9. C) -1 < P < 0

10. C) Spearman correlation coefficient = 1
